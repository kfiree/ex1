This project contains 3 interfaces and 3 classes who implements them.

The first class, NodeInfo, represents a node (vertex). the class is nessted in WGraph_Algo class 
the second class, WGraph_Algorepresents graph.
and the third class, WGraph_algo represents a set of operations applicable on the graph

Together they represents an unidirectional, weighted graph with a set of operations applicable on the graph, such as:
initialize a graph and manipulate it.
get the shortest path between 2 nodes and the size of this path if exists.
check if all nodes in graph are connected to each other.
and save and load a graph to a file
